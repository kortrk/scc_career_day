<!-- 
Three important web technologies:
  -       HTML: what the page is (like a title and some paragraphs)
  -        CSS: what the page looks like (we won't use that today)
  - Javascript: what the page does (in this case, draws a game on a canvas)

The tags you see like <h1> are HTML - the "language" that structures the web page.

<!-- For us to draw on a canvas, we have to create it first. -->
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="800" height="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">
  Sorry, your browser does not support canvas.
</canvas>

<!-- Javascript goes inside <script> tags. Here comes the big "coding" part: -->
<script>
  const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); // JS needs to recognize the canvas we made in HTML
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"); // a handle by which to work with the canvas

  // Object-oriented programming is a big concept in Computer Science,
  // but it's simple - in fact, simplifying things is why it exists.
  // OOP is all about representing concepts in code. In this case, we
  // want to tell our code:
  //  * What information targets need to track
  //     - "Where am I?", "What color am I?", "How big am I?"
  //  * What targets should do
  //     - Draw itself on the canvas, move across the screen
  class Target {
    constructor(x, y, radius, color, speed){
      // A constructor receives basic initial information about an object.

      this.x = x; // just like in math, we need an x and y to tell us...
      this.y = y; // where the stuff we're drawing goes on the canvas
      this.radius = radius;
      this.color = color;
      this.speed = speed; // we always set this to 3 but you can change it

      this.remove = false; // this will tell targets to go away
    }

    draw(){
      // outer circle
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
      ctx.fill(); // fill the target with our desired color now
      ctx.lineWidth = 1;
      ctx.strokeStyle = "gray"; // the outer edge of the target
      ctx.stroke(); // draw the border now

      // inner circle
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.radius * 0.5, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      ctx.lineWidth = 10;
      ctx.strokeStyle = "white";
      ctx.stroke();
    }

    update(){
      this.x += this.speed; // you could change the speed to make it more challenging

      if (this.x > canvas.width){
        this.remove = true; // detect if this target is off screen so we can remove
      }

      this.draw(); // don't forget to draw the target!
    }
  }

  // first we'll pick out some random colors for our targets
  var colors = []
  while (colors.length < 25){
    // in JavaScript, the whole spectrum of color
    // is represented by numbers from 0 to 360
    // 0 is red, 120 is green, 245 is blue, 360 is red again

    // Math.random gives you a decimal number between
    // 0 and 1, so multiplying 360 by it gives you
    // a random number between 0 and 360. We'll round
    // to the nearest whole number
    colors.push(Math.round(Math.random() * 360));
  }

  // now we'll use the colors we have to make targets!
  var targets = []
  for (color of colors){
    targets.push(
      new Target(
        Math.random() * -2000, // start the target offscreen
        Math.random() * canvas.height,
        40, // you could change this radius to change difficulty
        `hsl(${color}, 100%, 50%)`,
        3 // we always use 3 for speed - try changing this!
      )
    );
  }

  // There's one more important thing we need to do:
  // detect if a target is clicked!
  //
  // Whenever a click happens, an "event" fires
  // immediately. We'll respond to that event
  // by telling any targets that the mouse was on
  // during the click to take a "remove" status.
  canvas.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    const mouseX = event.clientX - rect.left;
    const mouseY = event.clientY - rect.top;

    // check all the targets
    for (target of targets){
      // see if this target was clicked
      var distance = Math.sqrt((mouseX - target.x) ** 2 + (mouseY - target.y) ** 2);

      if (distance <= target.radius){
        target.remove = true; // update the target's status
      }
    }
  });

  function loop() {
    // clear the canvas each time - otherwise the targets would
    // smudge their way across the screen (try removing this line to see it)
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // targets
    targets = targets.filter(t => !t.remove) // we want to remove the targets we marked
    targets.forEach(t => t.update()); // the targets themselves do most of the work

    // request the next frame of the animation
    requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  }

  // start the loop
  requestAnimationFrame(loop);
